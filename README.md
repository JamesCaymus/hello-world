My First Repository
I am a first-year student at the Community College of Rhode Island, studying Computer Science with a focus in Computer Programming. In my first semester, I learned the basics of Python in a class called Programming Concepts. I know that in order to understand the world of programming, one must understand how to use GitHub, so that is why I am writing this.
